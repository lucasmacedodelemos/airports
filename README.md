The airport project is a list of all airports from Portugal and the arrivals. The project implements an MVVM partner in Swift using the TDD concept.

### Clone

- Clone this repo to your local machine using `https://github.com/lucasmacedodelemos/airports.git`

### Configuration

- This project is created using: Xcode 11.3.1, Swift 4 and used iPhone 11 iOS 13.3 for development.

### Tests

- The tests are created using the TDD concept, so, first of all, I create the unit test and then I wait for the test to fail. The second step is to create the code and wait for the test to succeed.  Lastly, I make the code refactor if necessary.
- I preferred to create some tests that make the communication of the API's to test the logic of the service layer. Thus, it is necessary a connection with the internet to run the unit tests.
